## About myself

I love programming and have always been interested in psychology. Developing technical skills and communicating successfully with people are equally important to me. My experience in OOP with the automating business processes of an enterprise and accounting gives me a good basis for learning Front-End technology. And my desire to develop helps to find my own path.
